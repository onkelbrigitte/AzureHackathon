Learn how use Microsoft Azure and see what it can do for your IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) requirements. Additionally, we will showcase some innovative hardware, in particular our brand-new [Azure Kinect DK Camera](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kinect-dk/).

We will provide guided scenarios, practical advice and all nesserary prerequisites. We need you to bring your laptop, some programming skills and motivation to work on new things.

General prerequisites:

- Azure Account (bring your own if you have one, otherwise we will provide one)
- Laptop with internet access (doesn't really matter if running on Windows, Linux or MacOS). It needs to have a USB-A port.
- Ideally, Visual Studio Code and a Python runtime is installed. If not, we will provide a hosted Jupyter notebook.

What will we do in particular:

## IoT with Microsoft Azure.

We will connect a MCU (Microcontroller Unit) with onboard sensors, LCDs and other things to the [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/). With that setup, we will collect environmental data and run some analytics on top of that including a custom trained AI model.

#### Specific prerequisites:

## Infuse our apps with AI using Azure Cognitive Services

We will use Cognitive Services to implement several scenarios:

- Object Detection on images with our [Custom Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) and a PowerApp that will provide a convenient interface to train a Custom Vision model and classify objects. 
- Text anlytics of tweets and create audio files of them with our [Text-Analytics-API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) and our [Text-to-Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-translation/)
- Knowledge Mining on unstructured data (documents) with [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/).
